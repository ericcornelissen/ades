# Security Policy

The maintainers of the `ades` project take security issues seriously. We appreciate your efforts
to responsibly disclose your findings. Due to the non-funded and open-source nature of the project,
we take a best-efforts approach when it comes to engaging with security reports.

This document should be considered expired after 2024-12-31. If you are reading this after that date
you should try to find an up-to-date version in the official source repository.

## Supported Versions

Only the latest release of the project is supported with security updates.

## Reporting a Vulnerability

To report a security issue in the latest release or the development head, either:

- [Report it through GitHub][new github advisory], or
- Send an email to [security@ericcornelissen.dev] with the terms "SECURITY" and "ades" in the
  subject line.

Please do not open a regular issue or Pull Request in the public repository.

To report a security issue in an older version - i.e. the latest release isn't affected - please
report it publicly. For example, as a regular issue in the public repository. If in doubt, report
the issue privately.
