# Security Policy

The maintainers of the _ades_ project take security issues seriously. We
appreciate your efforts to responsibly disclose your findings. Due to the
non-funded and open-source nature of the project, we take a best-efforts
approach when it comes to engaging with security reports.

This document should be considered expired after 2027-01-01. If you are reading
this after that date you should try to find an up-to-date version in the
official source repository.

## Suported Versions

Only the latest release of the project is supported with security updates.

## Reporting a Vulnerability

To report a security issue in a supported version or the development head of the
project, either:

- [Report it through GitHub][new github advisory], or
- Send an email to [ericornelissen+security@gmail.com] with the terms "SECURITY"
  and "ades" in the subject line.

Please do not open a regular issue or Pull Request in the public repository.

If a security issue only affects an unsupported version of the project, please
report it publicly. For example, as a regular issue in the public repository. If
in doubt, report the issue privately.

[new github advisory]: https://github.com/ericcornelissen/ades/security/advisories/new
[ericornelissen+security@gmail.com]: mailto:ericornelissen+security@gmail.com?subject=SECURITY%20%28ades%29

### When to Report

Consider if the issue you found really is a security concern. Below you can find
guidelines for what is and isn't considered a security issue. Any issue that
does not fall into one of the listed categories should be reported based on your
own judgement. If in doubt, report the issue privately.

Any issue that is out of scope should still be reported, but can be reported
publicly because it is not considered sensitive.

#### In Scope

- Violations of the confidentiality of analyzed files.
- Violations of availability due to analyzed files.
- Insecure suggestions or snippets in the documentation.
- Security misconfigurations in the continuous integration pipeline or software
  supply chain.

#### Out of Scope

- Bugs in code not part of a published artifact.
- Insecure defaults or confusing API design.
- Known vulnerabilities in third-party dependencies.

### What to Include in a Report

Try to include as many of the following items as possible in a security report:

- An explanation of the problem
- A proof of concept exploit
- A suggested severity
- Relevant [CWE] identifiers
- The latest affected version
- The earliest affected version
- A suggested patch
- An automated regression test

## Threat Model

The standalone program considers the Go runtime and command line arguments as
trusted. The containerized program additionally considers the container runtime
used as trusted. The website considers the browser used as trusted. All other
inputs, most notably files and text to analyze, are considered untrusted. Any
violation of availability and confidentiality is considered a security issue.

The project considers the GitHub infrastructure and all project maintainers to
be trusted. Any action performed by any other GitHub user against the repository
is considered untrusted.

## Advisories

An advisory will be created only if a vulnerability affects at least one
released versions of the project. The affected versions range of an advisory
will by default include all unsupported versions of the project at the time of
disclosure.

All advisories are listed in the table below, ordered most to least recent by
publication date.

| ID               | Date       | Affected versions | Patched versions |
| :--------------- | :--------- | :---------------- | :--------------- |
| -                | -          | -                 | -                |

_This table is ordered most to least recent._
