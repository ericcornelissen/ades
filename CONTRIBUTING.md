# Contributing Guidelines

The maintainers of `ades` welcome contributions and corrections. This includes improvements to the
documentation or code base, tests, bug fixes, and implementations of new features. We recommend you
open an issue before making any substantial changes so you can be sure your work won't be rejected.
But for small changes, such as fixing a typo, you can open a Pull Request directly.

If you decide to make a contribution, please read the [DCO] and use the following workflow:

- Fork the repository.
- Create a new branch from the latest `main`.
- Make your changes on the new branch.
- Commit, with [signoff], to the new branch and push the commit(s).
- Open a Pull Request against `main`.
